Pandas-challenge Analysis
Data sets were provided which needed to go through collation so as to provide accurate data when interpreting certain values 
such as pass rates for certain subjects, average scores on those subjects, budgeting within them, and other values equally as prominent.
It is through sifting the given information that impacts can be made in future decisions tied with project(education) endeavors and maximizing the efficacy of those institutions
thus creating a more stable connection from provider to receipent. The interperted data is best used in an educational enviornment in regards to maximizing student scoring and passing rates, as well as understanding how to fund certain schools
so that improvements and areas of focus can be determined prior to any reprecussion of the current system.

Pandas-Challenge Conclusion
Through the spending_summary dataframe it can be best determined that the correlation between higher spending and higher scores across all topics of concern isn't strong. Due to such findings it would
be in the best interest of the superintendent of these schools to evaluate how the fund structuring for them should be as spending more money on each student lowers pass rates and scores, while those 
spending less than 585 dollars maintain an overall pass rate of 90% which is remarkable in comparison with the higher spending values.
Another conclusion can be drawn through the distiction of charter and district schools. As analyzed the 5 bottom performing schools were all of the district type where as all 5 of the top performing schools were of the charter type.
Better explained in the Scores by School Type dataframe that charters have a more beneficial impact on the academic wellbeing of stujdents as it boasts an ~37% increase in overall passing rate and substantial passing comparisons for both math and reading.
